/*An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number, pluperfect digital invariant, or pluperfect number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. In other words, an n-digit number is an Armstrong number if the sum of its digits, each raised to the nth power, is equal to the number itself.

For example, let's consider a 3-digit number 153:

1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153

Here, 153 is an Armstrong number because it is equal to the sum of its digits, each raised to the power of 3.*/

    while (n > 0) {
        int last_dig = n % 10;
        sum = sum + (last_dig * last_dig * last_dig);
        n = n / 10;
    }

    if (temp == sum) {
        cout << temp << " is an Armstrong number." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << temp << " is not an Armstrong number." << endl;
